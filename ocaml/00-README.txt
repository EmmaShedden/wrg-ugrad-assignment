This directory contains a list of eight short projects that are designed to 
get one used to certain tasks that occur commonly in PL research. 

Each task is described by its own README file. After you complete a task,
email me the source code and we'll take a look together -- if there are
more efficient ways to do things or little tricks, I'll mention them to
you. 

If you get stuck somewhere, just leave it and talk to me (or email me). 

Assignments 1 and 2 are quite easy. After that they become progressively more
complicated.
